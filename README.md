Developed a SASS dashboard using Next.js with React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Redux for state management, and RTK Query for efficient data fetching from the backend. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of transaction and wallet data for the signed-in user, featuring a graphical representation through charts and a dynamic filtering system. The application's state is effectively managed using Redux Toolkit, and backend data is queried using RTK Query.
